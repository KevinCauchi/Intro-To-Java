# Intro-To-Java

Java is a programming language that is widely used for developing software applications. It is a class-based, object-oriented language that allows developers to write code that is platform-independent, meaning it can run on multiple operating systems without modification. Some of the key features of Java include its strong type checking, automatic memory management, and built-in support for multi-threading. Java is commonly used in enterprise software development, mobile app development, and web development. An intro to Java coding class would typically cover the basics of the language, including data types, variables, control structures, and classes and objects. It may also introduce some of the key libraries and frameworks that are commonly used in Java development. The files provided were from labs and projects completed during my college semesters.
